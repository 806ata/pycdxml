## CDXMLStyler

CDXMLStyler is a tool to programmatically adjust the style of all the molecules contained in a cdxml file to the desired ChemDraw style. cdxml is the xml-based format of ChemDraw. This style-conversion can be achieved with ChemDraw itself but not in an automated fashion. Therefore the main purpose of the tool is batch conversion of cdxml files most likely coming from a database.
