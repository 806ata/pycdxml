# ChemDraw Tools

`chemdraw-tools` package contains several modules to support working with `cdxml`and `cdx`file formats used by ChemDraw in an automated, platform-independent way. Eg. the package works without needing to have ChemDraw installed and also on non-windows systems (untested but no reason it should not work, pure python).

Initially conceived as 3 separate projects / packages they were converted to a single project / git repository to simplify their management and because they partially depend on each other anyway. 

For example a usage scenario is to convert an RDKit molecules to `cdxml`, apply the desired ChemDraw Style to all of them and generated a `cdxml`file contain them all nicely aligned. If needed this `cdxml`file can then be converted to a binary `cdx`file or base64-encoded `cdx`Â string.

## Project Status

The overall status of the project can be described best as alpha-stage. It somewhat depends on the specific module used and how you use it. Within the limited scope of basic small molecules, the code will mostly work. Of course I'm sure there are some unknown bugs and edge-cases not present in my set of test molecules but staying in that scope, any you will probably be fine.

Where you might run into issues is with more complex salts, reactions and for sure organometallics.

It's best to limit usage to "single-molecule" documents essentially treating the ChemDraw files like mol files. `cdxml`and `cdx` are more like a drawing file format with molecules as first class citizens and not a pure chemical format. Using any of these "drawing features" can lead to errors or worse silent issues. You have been warned!

## ChemDraw Converter

`chemdraw_converter`module allows you to convert between `cdxml`and `cdx` files. Reading in a cdx into the internal representation and writing it out again will lead to a 100% identical file on binary level (if only supported features are used). 

There is also experimental support to convert [RDKit](https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit) molecules to ChemDraw files.

The conversions are based on PerkinElmers (formerly CambridgeSofts) official but very much outdated format specification available [here](https://www.cambridgesoft.com/services/documentation/sdk/chemdraw/cdx/IntroCDX.htm). Some features required some "reverse engineering" as they are either new or different from the specification. For more details see the README.md in the modules directory.

## CDXMLStyler

`cdxml_styler` module converts the style of the molecules contained in the `cdxml`document. The style options are limited to options that directly affect the display of the molecule like bond length, atom label size and so forth. The core usage scenario here is to convert a bunch of `cdxml`documents containing just molecule drawings to a standardized style.

If you have `cdx`files, convert them to `cdxml`with the `chemdraw_converter`module, apply the style and convert back to `cdx`. That is in general the basic idea of this package. Do all manipulation in `cdxml`because due to it being `xml`it's relatively easy to do such manipulations in contrast to the binary `cdx`format.

For more details see the README.md in the modules directory.

## CDXML Slide Generator

`cdxml_slide_generator` module does a similar thing as my [`molecule-slide-generator`](https://github.com/kienerj/molecule-slide-generator)package but with a `cdxml`file as output. In essence the passed-in molecules and their properties are put into a single `cdxml`file nicely aligned with the properties as text below them. Properties can be anything of your choice like an activity value or simply a name or compound id. 

Internally it makes use of CDXMLStyler to convert input molecules to the same style.
